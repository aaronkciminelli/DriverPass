# DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam, the owner, Ian the IT Officer, are clients of the system "DriverPass." The system they request to design is an online learning management system that will make it easier for people to prepare for the DMV Test. As well as offering classes and practice tests, the system will also be able to schedule on-the-road training sessions. DriverPass is dedicated to ensuring everyone has the tools necessary to pass their Drivers Test successfully on the first attempt.

What did you do particularly well?

In this project, I feel that I created my diagrams particularly well. In addition, I feel that I am a visual learner, and the diagrams helped me visualize the project in a more comprehensive manner. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my interpretations of the diagrams and summarize them more clearly and logically. I feel I summarized my description in a more "manner-of-fact" rather than considering a non-technical audience. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I feel as though I interpreted the user's needs cautiously and satisfactorily. Considering the user's needs when designing is essential because the project is essentially their vision. It's essential to educate clients on functions and methods; however, a programmer should make every attempt to satisfy the client's goals. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I like to break everyday tasks down into smaller, more accomplishable goals. For instance, when I need to organize my garage, I plan to organize things by type, seasonal use, and how often I use them. This is very similar to planning and designing a system because I need to break down objects and functions into similar categories.
